# Access Kaiser Health Data via iPhone and Apple Health

This shows how I am exploring my downloaded Kaiser data. 

Disclaimer: I am not medically trained, and have no documentation on the file format. This code is NOT for making medical decisions. There may be missing data and actual errors.  
I recommend discussing anything interesting you find with your doctor.

# How to get your data

1. What I did was go to the Apple Health app on my iPhone. 
2. Selected my profile picture to open my profile. 
2. Select "Health Records". "Add Accounts", and follow the prompts.
3. The go back to the profile and select "Export All Data". This exports ALL your data - in my case around 50MB, with an earliest record of 2007, I assume that's when they went digital.
4. For me, it offered an airdrop option to my mac, but you can save it to files, I think, and move it where you want from there.

All of the above should be possible without an iPhone, but that's how I did it.
